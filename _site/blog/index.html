  <h1>Writing</h1>
  <p>I do not write as well or as often as I would like. Nonetheless, I have put some things here for the readers' perusal. If you're taking the time to read them, I sincerely hope you enjoy.</p>
  <ul style="line-height: 200%"><li><a href="/blog/graduating/">Graduating</a>: I received a graduate degree in December 2021 and wrote about it</li><li><a href="/blog/pensee/">Pensee</a>: In 2020, I curated a Cognitive Science newsletter with a friend. The venture did not last very long, but when I look back at it, I am impressed with the editions we put out.</li>
