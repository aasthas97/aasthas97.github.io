      <p>Who am I and why am I eligible to lecture y’all on the fucked-up-ness of life (aside from the fact that this is my blog and you’re the visitor)? Excellent question.</p>
<p>I have had a rat in my house since July. It never caused any destruction, just came and went and pranced around. As a scientific and resourceful human, I did my Googling and texted my mother’s friends for desi nuskhe. I tried everything – traps, poison, various delicacies offered as bait – but this rat seemed to have evolved higher cognitive and evasive capacities.</p>
<p>Anyway, on a very ordinary Tuesday morning, I woke up feeling gloomy and decided to mark a week of being dumped with a solitary walk. That’s what people who get dumped do, you see, we roam around alone in the world. The weather was decent, I tried my hardest to appreciate nature and convince myself that not all had been lost. Except my left foot felt weird. My shoes are pretty old so I assumed that, much like my mental state, they were beginning to fall apart. I continued to walk. 1200 metres in, I could not ignore my foot anymore, sat down and took my shoe off to inspect the matter.</p>
<p>The great news is that my house rat is certainly dead.</p>
<p>When asked to introduce myself, I like to say that I am the girl who has a lot of words and instead of sharing them with the world like a normal person, I put them on an anonymous blog for nobody. And I am the girl who goes for long walks with a dead rat in her shoe.</p>
