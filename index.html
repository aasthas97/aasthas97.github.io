        Hi, I'm Aastha. I'm a software developer in Berlin. I studied Biology at the University of Delhi because I was fascinated by brains. Then I went to the Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur to study Cognitive Science because I thought brains and coding was a nice combination. I like writing code and discovering new things about computers and networks. I also like reading, cooking Indian food, drinking coffee, and talking about food, culture, and philosophy.</p>

          My primary work is focused on front-end development for EEG software. I also
          built and manage a clinical permission management application and
          integrated

          I worked on an image recognition and classification model that
          segmented rice grains from pictues and classified them into 8
          pre-defined categories. Traditionally, this segmentation and
          classification is done by humans manually, which is time-consuming,
          inconsistent and error-prone. Automating the process made it faster
          and traceable. I also built web and Android UIs (using Django and
          React, respectively) that allowed users to use the model easily.
