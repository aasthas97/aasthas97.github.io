      <h1>Hi, I'm Aastha!</h1>
      <p>
        I am a software developer based in Berlin. I write code, enjoy reading, and try not to take myself too seriously. 
        I studied Biology at the University of Delhi and Cognitive Science at the Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur.
        Lately, I have also been recording short stories and audiobooks in my free time.

          My primary work is focused on front-end development for EEG software. I also
          built and manage a clinical permission management application and
          integrated
          <a href="https://www.hl7.org/about/index.cfm?ref=nav">H7</a>-compliant

          I worked on an image recognition and classification model that
          segmented rice grains from pictues and classified them into 8
          pre-defined categories. Traditionally, this segmentation and
          classification is done by humans manually, which is time-consuming,
          inconsistent and error-prone. Automating the process made it faster
          and traceable. I also built web and Android UIs (using Django and
          React, respectively) that allowed users to use the model easily.
