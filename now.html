        <p>
          Didn't get much of a chance to relax during the holidays - I travelled, fell sick, deep-cleaned, and carried out a bunch of small repairs around the house. The remaining free time was spent watching trash TV and chiding myself for it. Made some progress with my German, though. I have also been getting back into bouldering and might finally invest in a pair of shoes. Speaking of investing, I am also finally learning about personal finance. Guess I have fully transitioned to adult life now.

          <p>Things/places/people I have discovered recently:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Austrian Nightjet Rail: Not much of a hidden secret, but I love trains and the overnight sleeper travel experience on this one was fabulous.
            </li>
            <li>
              House of Music Budapest: Very fun, very interactive. Especially interesting to learn about the central Asian influence on Hungarian (folk) music.
            </li>
            <li>Aattam: Malayalam cinema continues to be, on average, miles ahead of Bollywood. Watching Aattam, which literally means The Play, feels like watching a play. Interesting directorial choice, if it was intentional.</li>
          </ul>
