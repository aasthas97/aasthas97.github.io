      <h1>Now</h1>
      <p><i>Updated on April 28th, 2024.</i></p>
      <p>Finally started learning German, although I am barely making the time to properly study. German grammar feels a bit frustrating to me. Figuring out <i>der, die, das</i> reminds me of my non-Hindi-speaking friends' struggles with genders of words in Hindi. My espresso machine broke recently and after many struggles with repair shops around Berlin, I have decided to repair it myself (with help from a kind human I met on Reddit). Also got my bike out after the winter but the lights refuse to work. On the work front, I've decided to learn some networking and how to monitor and test network performance. I'm very excited! And I attended a Django workshop by Django Girls Berlin last weekend. Maybe I'll make a reading tracker with Django.</p>

        <p>Things/places I have discovered recently:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Urban Gladiators in Kreuzberg: A little far off for me, but I try to go when I can.</li>
            <li><a href="https://grocy.info/">Grocy</a>: Some people have told me it's obsessive/overkill. I love this home ERP system.</li>
