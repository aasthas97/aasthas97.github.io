          This month has been spent in a rut and something resembling an existential crisis. On one hand, my brain is pushing me to <i>create</i> and on the other, it is actively denying to do so. I ended up speaking to a lot of old friends, though, so even the self-questioning has a silver lining. My German progress has also plateaued. On the brighter side, I had the chance to visit the King's College Chapel in Cambridge and bought a bunch of cookbooks from Oxfam for very cheap. Now all that's left is to find the motivation to actually read them and try something new.
          <br>
          I binge-watched the Hannibal movie trilogy (skipped Hannibal Rising) and Season One of the TV series. I had big hopes from TV, but the second half of the season did not appeal to me.
