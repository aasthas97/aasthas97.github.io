          I finally caved and bought a domain (which is where I hope you are
          reading this). After over a month of frustration, I managed to fix my
          espresso machine (with help from a kind human I met on Reddit). I
          would like to try and fix other electrical appliances now. The pollen
          in Berlin continues to torture me. Seriously, I am sneezing as I type
          this. Many fun things happening on the work front. I learnt about the
          OSI model not too long ago and now I am somehow implementing TLS
          encryption. Oh and I wrote Ansible code for the first time. It is both
          exciting and daunting. The imposter syndrome is real right now, but I
          am determined to not let it stop me from trying something new.

          <p>Things/places/people I have discovered recently:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Berlin Bookclub without fixed books: I love bookclubs but I do
              not always want to read the books they prescribe, so this group
              feels perfect.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://grocy.info/">Grocy</a>: Some people have told me
              it's obsessive/overkill. I love this home ERP system.
