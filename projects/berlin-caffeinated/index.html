            Reviewing the cafes I visit in Berlin. Most of them are in and
            around Friedrichshain. I usually order a single coffee and either a
            croissant or dessert. I am not a coffee expert, by any means. Nor am
            I a very eloquent reviewer. I simply enjoy drinking coffee and
            documenting my experience.

            PS. I am also slowly learning German and will try to add
            translations soon. :)

        “Police work wouldn't be possible without coffee," Wallander said. "No
        work would be possible without coffee." They pondered the importance of
        coffee in silence.”<br />― Henning Mankell, One Step Behind

      This design was taken from The Odin Project's
      <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page"
        >Landing Page assignment</a
      >. I took some creative liberties of my own. The page does not look great
      on a phone. I need to work on that. :)
