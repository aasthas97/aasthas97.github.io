# On technological freedom

I have a hot take to share. I harbour a deep dislike for Apple devices. I hate how Apple pioneered locking users into an ecosystem and dictating their choices, in the name of performance and design. And I hate even more the fact that we're all somehow okay with it. We're so okay with it that we're overlooking how other big tech companies are going this way, too. I am not a privacy expert. Nor am I completely FAANG-free (I still use a Google phone, for one). But I hate how every aspect of technology is being changed to serve corporations instead of people. Our right to choice is being taken away from us. Every aspect of our lives is data to be collected, analyzed and used to make us dance to the tunes of algorithms. We need to reclaim this control and, as an absolute privacy noob, I am here to hopefully convince you that the reclamation is not as hard as our capitalist overlords would have you believe.
