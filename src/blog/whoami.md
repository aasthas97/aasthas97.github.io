Who am I and why am I eligible to lecture y’all on the fucked-up-ness of life (aside from the fact that this is my blog and you’re the visitor)? Excellent question.

I have had a rat in my house since July. It never caused any destruction, just came and went and pranced around. As a scientific and resourceful human, I did my Googling and texted my mother’s friends for desi nuskhe. I tried everything – traps, poison, various delicacies offered as bait – but this rat seemed to have evolved higher cognitive and evasive capacities.

Anyway, on a very ordinary Tuesday morning, I woke up feeling gloomy and decided to mark a week of being dumped with a solitary walk. That’s what people who get dumped do, you see, we roam around alone in the world. The weather was decent, I tried my hardest to appreciate nature and convince myself that not all had been lost. Except my left foot felt weird. My shoes are pretty old so I assumed that, much like my mental state, they were beginning to fall apart. I continued to walk. 1200 metres in, I could not ignore my foot anymore, sat down and took my shoe off to inspect the matter.

The great news is that my house rat is certainly dead.

When asked to introduce myself, I like to say that I am the girl who has a lot of words and instead of sharing them with the world like a normal person, I put them on an anonymous blog for nobody. And I am the girl who goes for long walks with a dead rat in her shoe.
