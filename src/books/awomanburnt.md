'A Woman Burnt' is the story of Revathi, a young, well-educated (she's an engineer), upper-class and upper-caste woman from Tamil Nadu. She harbours dreams of getting a job and living independently. While staying with her parents, she meets and falls in love with auto-driver Ravi. Ravi is, in every sense, Revathi's opposite. Hot-headed, impulsive, possessive, uneducated, lower-caste, poorer than Revathi's family. After much drama, Revathi marries Ravi.
The bulk of the story takes place a few years after their marriage. Revathi is admitted to a hospital with severe burns. Various characters come and go through the course of her treatment. Her parents are devastated and blame Ravi. Ravi is angry and scared (perhaps also guilty) and drowns himself in alcohol. Family members, relatives and friends offer advice, support and comments.
The writing is quite clinical and descriptive. In my opinion, a reader is free to take from it what they wish to.
