    Hi, I'm Aastha. I'm a software developer based in Berlin. I studied Biology
    at the University of Delhi because I was fascinated by brains. Then I
    went to the Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur to study Cognitive
    Science and learn how/if brains lead to behaviour. I
    enjoy writing code and discovering new things about computers and
    networks. I also like reading, cooking, drinking coffee, theatre,
    and talking about food, culture, and philosophy.
    <br /> I am a volunteer at the <a href="https://blindrelief.org/">Blind Relief Association, Delhi</a> and <a href="https://rueckenwind.berlin/">RÃ¼ckenwind e.V. Berlin</a>.
