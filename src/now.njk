  <h1>Now</h1>
  <p><i>Updated on June 23rd, 2025.</i></p>
  <p>
    I'm trying to teach myself Economics and have much gratitude for MIT OCW's extensive offering of MOOCs. I also intend to make my way through 'A Gentle Introduction to the Art of Mathematics', although slowed down by other demands of everyday life.<br/>I've begun to play badminton regularly after 4 years and recently tried improv in German.

        KoReader: This has changed my life and I'm using my Kindle more than ever before.

      <li>Sister Midnight: I'm not the most evolved cinephile and don't know how I feel about this film. My more cultured acquaintances enjoyed it.</li>
