  <h1>Now</h1>
  <p><i>Updated on September 17th, 2025.</i></p>
  <p>
    Participated in ML4Good Germany in September 2025, met cool people, learnt a bunch about AI safety and governance. Back in Berlin now and resuming work on a CorrelAid project. I haven't used R in a long time and it has, so far, been a pain to set up. I also moved some of my writing pieces from an old, anonymous blog to this website. See my <a href="/blog">blog</a>!
    The past month was very chaotic and I am going to travel some more in the upcoming weeks (perhaps months).
