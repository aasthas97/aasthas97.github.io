  <h1>Now</h1>
  <p><i>Updated on July 7th, 2025.</i></p>
  <p>
    I'm trying to teach myself Economics and have much gratitude for MIT OCW's extensive offering of MOOCs. I also intend to make my way through 'A Gentle Introduction to the Art of Mathematics', although slowed down by other demands of everyday life.<br/>I've begun to play badminton regularly after 4 years and recently tried improv in German.

    <p>Things/places/people I have discovered recently:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> MIT's "Introduction to Microeconomics" Course</li>
      <li> Archive of our Own: I've been reading an embarassing amount of fanfiction lately and AO3 is feeding my addiction</li> 
      <li> Rückenwind eV: Really ventured outside my comfort zone and started repairing bicycles at Rückenwind</li>
    </ul>
